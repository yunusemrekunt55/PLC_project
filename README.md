# PLC Ladder Diagram Project

## 📌 Project Description
This project demonstrates how a **Programmable Logic Controller (PLC)** system is programmed and controlled using **Ladder Diagram**. A specific **Water Purification** has been implemented, and a Ladder program has been developed for this purpose.

## 📂 Project Contents
This repository contains the following files:
- **AutonomousWaterPurification_withPLC.pdf** → A detailed report explaining the project in PDF format

## 🛠 Tools and Technologies Used
- **PLC Software:** PLCnext
- **Programming Type:** Ladder Logic (LD)
- **Hardware:** Phoenix Contact Starter Kit

## ⚙️ How to Run
1. **To open the Ladder diagram:**
   - If a specific software (e.g., TIA Portal) is used, open the **LadderDiagram.ladder** file within the software.
   - Alternatively, if the Ladder diagram is available in an image format (PNG, JPG, etc.), you can view it directly.

2. **To upload to a PLC:**
   - Transfer the **Ladder diagram** to the appropriate PLC program.
   - Configure the **connections and I/O (input/output) settings** correctly.
   - **Compile and simulate** the program.
   - Upload it to the PLC and complete the testing process.
